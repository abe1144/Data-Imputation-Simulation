# Data Imputation On Survey Data

Missing data is a common problem that arises in many modern applications. In terms of survey
data, missing data is commonly due to non-response of the chosen unit for the sample. Missing
data can be classified as unit nonresponse or item nonresponse. If left untreated, this can lead to
nonresponse bias. In the case of item nonresponse, missing mechanisms can be further classified,
and solutions such as imputation can be used to correct for nonresponse bias. The simulation
presented in this paper attempts to investigate the effectiveness of imputation in terms of point
estimation, under each missing mechanisms.

This simulation project was done for the course Stat 454 offered at the University of Waterloo.
